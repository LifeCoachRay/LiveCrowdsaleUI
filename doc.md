Getting Started

Welcome to the CrowdSale Website project. This guide will help you get the project up and running on your local development environment.

Prerequisites
Before starting, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

A web browser (e.g. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari)
A text editor (e.g. Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code)
Setup
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the HTML file in your web browser and text editor.
Modify the code as needed to make changes to the website.
Customization
You can customize the appearance and functionality of the website by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in the project. Here are a few tips to get started:

To change the layout and styling of the website, you can modify the CSS styles in the <style> tag in the <head> of the HTML file.
To add or modify the content of the website, you can modify the HTML elements in the <body> of the HTML file.
To add or modify the behavior of the website, you can modify the JavaScript code in the <script> tag at the end of the HTML file.
Deployment
To deploy the website, you will need to host it on a web server. There are many options for hosting websites, such as hosting it on a server you set up yourself or using a third-party hosting service. Once you have chosen a hosting solution, you can upload the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the server and make the website live for users to access.
